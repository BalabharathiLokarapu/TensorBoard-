    "# TensorBoard Scalars: Logging basic training metrics in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic task in machine learning is understanding how key metrics such as loss and accuracy change as training progresses. These metrics can help you understand if you're [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting), for example, or if you're unnecessarily training for too long. You may also want to compare these metrics across different training runs to help debug and improve your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow's Scalar Summary API allows you to visualize these metrics in TensorBoard with very little effort. This tutorial presents a very basic example to give you an introduction to using Scalar Summaries when developing your Keras model.\n"
