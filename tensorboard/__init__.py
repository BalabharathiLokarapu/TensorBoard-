  """Writes `Summary` protocol buffers to event files.

  The `FileWriter` class provides a mechanism to create an event file in a
  given directory and add summaries and events to it. The class updates the
  file contents asynchronously. This allows a training program to call methods
  to add data to the file directly from the training loop, without slowing down
  training.

    """Creates a `FileWriter` and an event file.

    On construction the summary writer creates a new event file in `logdir`.
    This event file will contain `Event` protocol buffers constructed when you
    call one of the following functions: `add_summary()`, `add_session_log()`,
    `add_event()`, or `add_graph()`.

    If you pass a `Graph` to the constructor it is added to
    the event file. (This is equivalent to calling `add_graph()` later).

    TensorBoard will pick the graph from the file and display it graphically so
    you can interactively explore the graph you built. You will usually pass
    the graph from the session in which you launched it:

    ```python
    ...create a graph...
    # Launch the graph in a session.
    sess = tf.Session()
    # Create a summary writer, add the 'graph' to the event file.
    writer = tb.FileWriter(<some-directory>, sess.graph)
    ```

    The other arguments to the constructor control the asynchronous writes to
    the event file:

    *  `flush_secs`: How often, in seconds, to flush the added summaries
       and events to disk.
    *  `max_queue`: Maximum number of summaries or events pending to be
       written to disk before one of the 'add' calls block.

    Args:
      logdir: A string. Directory where event file will be written.
      graph: A `Graph` object, such as `sess.graph`.
      max_queue: Integer. Size of the queue for pending events and summaries.
      flush_secs: Number. How often, in seconds, to flush the
        pending events and summaries to disk.
      filename_suffix: A string. Every event file's name is suffixed with
        `suffix`.
