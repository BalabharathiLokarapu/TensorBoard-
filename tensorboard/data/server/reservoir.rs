/// A [reservoir sampling] data structure, with support for preemption and deferred "commits" of
/// records to a separate destination for better concurrency.
///
/// This structure always keeps the latest record in the reservoir, and therefore must inspect
/// every record in the stream. (One exception: when the reservoir's capacity is zero, it does not
/// retain any records, even the latest one.)
///
/// **Note:** Preemption support is not yet implemented.
///
/// # Preemption
///
/// All records stored in this reservoir have a *step* and a *payload*. The step, a non-negative
/// integer, is expected to be monotonically (strictly) increasing over time. Whenever a new record
/// arrives with step `s`, it preempts any records with steps not smaller than `s`.
///
/// This is motivated by preemptions of nondeterministic training jobs. If a job is checkpointed at
/// step 80 and preempted at step 100, any metrics written between steps 81 and 100 will be
/// recomputed when the job restarts. Since the outputs may be nondeterministic, the old values
/// must be discarded to avoid a misleading discontinuity between steps 100 and 101.
///
/// For the purpose of this reservoir, preemption is considered a normal mode of operation, not an
/// error. However, jobs incorrectly configured to emit non-increasing steps without being
/// preempted may find that this reservoir does not behave as they expect. For instance, a job that
/// emits many records all at step 0 will find that only one record is retained in the reservoir.
///
/// # Deferred commits
///
/// This reservoir is designed to maximize throughput of reading records from disk while still
/// providing a live-updating view to clients. To do so, we separate the data structures that the
/// reading worker must modify from the clients' view. Each reservoir has an associated [`Basin`],
/// which holds the events that have been committed and made visible to clients. The worker may own
/// the stage exclusively, without any locks or synchronization. At any time, the worker may take a
/// write-lock of the basin and update it with the changes from the reservoir. (The reservoir
/// drains into the basin.) For instance, the worker might have a policy of committing "every 1000
/// records read, or every 10 large records read, or every 5 seconds, whichever comes first".
///
/// The commit operation is quite fast: not only does it not do much work per record being
/// committed, it only commits records that have made it through the sampling process. Thus, if
/// 1000 records are read and 900 of them are discarded, deferring the commit operation will have
/// saved 900 records' worth of wasted copies, compared to if the basin were always kept exactly up
/// to date. Assuming that the basin is shared under a [`std::sync::RwLock`] or similar, the
/// critical section in which the worker needs a write-lock should be short, and thus clients may
/// normally enjoy an uncontended view of the basin.
