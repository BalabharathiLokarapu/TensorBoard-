def op(name, tensor, sample_rate, max_outputs=3, collections=None,
       family=None):
  """Create a audio summary op in a TensorFlow graph.

  The summary has up to `max_outputs` summary values containing audio. The
  audio is built from `tensor` which must be 3-D with shape `[batch_size,
  frames, channels]` or 2-D with shape `[batch_size, frames]`. The values are
  assumed to be in the range of `[-1.0, 1.0]` with a sample rate of
  `sample_rate`.

  The `tag` in the outputted Summary.Value protobufs is generated based on the
  name, with a suffix depending on the max_outputs setting:

  *  If `max_outputs` is 1, the summary value tag is '*name*/audio'.
  *  If `max_outputs` is greater than 1, the summary value tags are
     generated sequentially as '*name*/audio/0', '*name*/audio/1', etc


  Args:
    name: A name for the generated node. The TensorFlow naming system will
      modify this name to fit into the name scope in the graph. For example, if
      the name "loss" is passed, and is inside a scope called "tower_1", the
      name will be "tower_1/loss". This full name will be used as the tag,
      meaning it controls the display name in TensorBoard.
    tensor: A 3-D `float32` `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, frames, channels]`
      or a 2-D `float32` `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, frames]`.
    sample_rate: A Scalar `float32` `Tensor` indicating the sample rate of the
      signal in hertz.
    max_outputs: Max number of batch elements to generate audio for.
    collections: Optional list of graph collections keys. The new summary op is
      added to these collections. Defaults to `["summaries"]`.
    family: Optional; if provided, used as the prefix of the summary tag name.
      For example, if the name "loss" is passed in a name scope called
      "tower_1", the name would normally be "tower_1/loss". But perhaps you
      want to group every important metric together in their own tag group.
      If you passed the family "important", then the tag would be
      "important/tower_1/loss".

  Returns:
    An audio summary op. When that op is run, it generates a scalar `Tensor` of
    type `string`, which contains a `Summary` protobuf with serialized audio
    data.
