// steps.

// Note that Sessions can consist of multiple Tensorboard "runs", since in
// a distributed Tensorflow deployment, training can be accomplished using
// several cooporating processes, each one emitting Summary data to a different
// log directory or run. For example, in a single session one process could
// periodically compute the loss on the validation set, and another could
// compute the loss on the training set.
