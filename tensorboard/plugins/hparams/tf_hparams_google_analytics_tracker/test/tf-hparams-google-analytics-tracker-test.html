  <!-- We don't track users in open-source. Thus, 
       tf-hparams-google-analytics-tracker is an object whose methods are no-ops
       and thus doesn't need tests. We keep this file here instead of deleting
       it entirely, so that we don't need to change the sites where its used
       as well when syncing the code back to Google's internal repo. -->
