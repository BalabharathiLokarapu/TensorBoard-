    If no region name is passed, the result is a decorator. If a region

    valid usages:

    Args:
        region_name: An optional string name to associate with this
            latency region. Optional if used as a decorator; required if
            used as a context manager.
        log_level: Optional integer logging level constant. Defaults to
            `logging.INFO`.

    Returns:
        A decorated version of the input callable, or a dual
        decorator/context manager with the input region name.
